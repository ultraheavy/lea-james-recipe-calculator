- [ ] Add loading states for better UX
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh where appropriate
- [ ] Test all pages on mobile devices

## Sprint 3: Menu Management System (Week 3)
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**Goal**: Build comprehensive menu management tools

### Day 1-2: Menu Builder Interface
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop menu builder
- [ ] Implement menu categories
- [ ] Add menu item ordering
- [ ] Build menu preview functionality
- [ ] Support multiple active menus

### Day 3: Menu Operations
- [ ] Bulk menu item assignment
- [ ] Menu cloning/templating
- [ ] Seasonal menu support
- [ ] Menu version comparison tools
- [ ] Export menu to PDF/print

### Day 4-5: Menu Analytics
- [ ] Menu engineering matrix
- [ ] Profitability analysis by category
- [ ] Menu mix reports
- [ ] Price optimization suggestions
- [ ] Historical menu performance

## Sprint 4: Architecture Refactoring (Week 4)
**Duration**: 5 days  
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability and performance

### Day 1-2: Break Up Monolithic app.py
- [ ] Extract routes into blueprints:
  - `routes/inventory.py`
  - `routes/recipes.py`
  - `routes/menus.py`
  - `routes/reports.py`
- [ ] Create service layer classes
- [ ] Move business logic out of routes

### Day 3: Implement Repository Pattern
- [ ] Create repository classes:
  - `InventoryRepository`
  - `RecipeRepository`
  - `MenuRepository`
- [ ] Centralize all SQL queries
- [ ] Add query builder helpers
- [ ] Implement unit of work pattern

### Day 4-5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add database indexes for common queries
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for:
  - Recipe calculations
  - Inventory lookups
  - Menu data
- [ ] Add connection pooling
- [ ] Optimize N+1 query problems

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Process
1. Create feature branch for each sprint
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as you go
4. Get code review before merging
5. Deploy to staging for testing

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mobile testing on real devices
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Security testing for new features

### Documentation Updates
- Update README with new features
- Document API changes
- Create user guides for new functionality
- Update architecture diagrams
- Maintain changelog

### Deployment Strategy
1. Database migrations first
2. Deploy backend changes
3. Deploy frontend changes
4. Run smoke tests
5. Monitor error logs

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% recipe cost accuracy (no >100% food costs)
- [ ] All recipes have complete ingredients
- [ ] Mobile navigation works on all devices
- [ ] Page load time <2 seconds
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for new code
- [ ] User satisfaction improvement

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Implement automated backups before changes
- **Performance**: Load test with production data volumes
- **Compatibility**: Test with all themes and devices
- **Security**: Regular dependency updates and audits
- **User Disruption**: Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Future Enhancements (Post-Sprint 4)
- Integration with POS systems
- Advanced analytics and ML predictions
- Multi-location support
- Supplier integration APIs
- Mobile app development
- Real-time collaboration features
