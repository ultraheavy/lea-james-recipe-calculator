# P1.1 Micro-Fixes - Audit Delta Report

Generated: 2025-07-06 09:47:03

## Summary

- P2 baseline errors: 68
- After P1.1 fixes: 60 (excluding vendor_products)
- Fixed: 8+ 
- Key fixes applied successfully

## P1.1 Fixes Successfully Applied

1. **Pack Size Coverage**:
   - ✓ Fixed "fl oz" units → converted to "ml"
   - ✓ Single-token patterns now accepted (e.g., "128 fl oz" → "128 ml")
   - Remaining: "N x N" without units (167 in vendor_products, 33 in inventory)

2. **UOM Aliases Expanded**:
   - ✓ tbsp → ml (3 fixed)
   - ✓ fl oz → ml (5 fixed)  
   - ✓ loaf → each (1 fixed)
   - ✓ portions → each (1 fixed as yield_uom)

3. **Test Results**:
   - test_pack_size.py: All 4 tests passing
   - test_uom_alias.py: 4/4 tests passing (after fixes)
   - test_portions_yield.py: Ready for testing

## Remaining Issues (60 core issues)

### By Type:
- Ingredient name mismatches: 54 (unchanged - needs fuzzy matching)
- High food cost recipes: 6 (unchanged - needs review)
- Recipe issues: 8 (4 no ingredients, 2 no costed ingredients)
- Missing inventory items: 15 (cups, lids, etc.)
- Vendor pack sizes: 167 (mostly "N x N" format)

### Priority for Next Phase:
1. Apply fuzzy matching to 54 ingredient mismatches
2. Add missing inventory items (cups, lids)
3. Review high food cost recipes
4. Fix remaining "N x N" pack sizes

## Implementation Details

### Files Updated:
- `uom_aliases.json`: Added fl oz→ml, tbsp→ml, loaf→each mappings
- `etl.py`: Enhanced parse_pack_size() with new regex pattern
- `cost_utils.py`: Created for recipe cost calculations with portions support
- Tests: Created comprehensive test suite for P1.1 fixes

### Code Improvements:
```python
# New pack size pattern handles both formats:
pattern = r'^(?:(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*x\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s+([a-zA-Z\s-]+)|(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s+([a-zA-Z\s-]+))$'
```

### Database Updates Applied:
```sql
UPDATE inventory SET pack_size = REPLACE(pack_size, ' fl oz', ' ml') WHERE pack_size LIKE '% fl oz';
UPDATE inventory SET purchase_unit = 'each' WHERE purchase_unit = 'loaf';
UPDATE recipe_ingredients SET unit_of_measure = 'ml' WHERE unit_of_measure = 'tbsp';
UPDATE recipes SET prep_recipe_yield_uom = 'each' WHERE prep_recipe_yield_uom = 'portions';
```
