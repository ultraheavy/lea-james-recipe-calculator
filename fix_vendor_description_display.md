# Fix for Vendor Description Display Issue

## Problem Summary
The inventory page shows a "Vendor Description" column that displays redundant data 94.5% of the time. The vendor_descriptions table contains mostly identical values to item_description.

## Current State
- 217 out of 250 items have vendor descriptions
- 205 (94.5%) are identical to the item description
- Only 12 (5.5%) provide unique vendor descriptions

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Conditional Display (Recommended)
Only show vendor description when it differs from item description:

```python
# In app.py inventory route, modify the query:
SELECT i.*, 
       v.vendor_name as primary_vendor_name,
       vp.vendor_item_code,
       vp.vendor_price as vendor_current_price,
       CASE 
           WHEN vd.vendor_description != i.item_description 
           THEN vd.vendor_description 
           ELSE NULL 
       END as vendor_description
FROM inventory i 
LEFT JOIN vendor_products vp ON i.id = vp.inventory_id AND vp.is_primary = 1
LEFT JOIN vendors v ON vp.vendor_id = v.id
LEFT JOIN vendor_descriptions vd ON i.id = vd.inventory_id 
    AND (vd.vendor_name = v.vendor_name OR vd.vendor_name = i.vendor_name)
ORDER BY i.item_description
```

### Option 2: Remove Column
Simply remove the "Vendor Description" column from the UI since it adds little value.

### Option 3: Rename Column
Change "Vendor Description" to "Product Description" to accurately reflect what's being shown.

## Items with Meaningful Vendor Descriptions
These 12 items have unique vendor descriptions that add value:
1. N/A Bev, Soda, Fanta, Orange, Mexican → "N/A Bev, SODA ORANGE MEXICAN GLASS"
2. N/A Bev, Tea, Regular → "N/A Bev, Tea,, 4oz, 3 Gal YIeld"
3. Dry Good, Cayenne Pepper, Spice → "Cayenne Pepper 40SHU"
... (and 9 others)

## Implementation Steps
1. Backup database
2. Update the SQL query in app.py
3. Optionally update the column header in inventory_modern.html
4. Test to ensure only meaningful vendor descriptions are shown
