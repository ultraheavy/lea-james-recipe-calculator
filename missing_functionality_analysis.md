# Missing Functionality Analysis

## üîç ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

### 1. **Item List vs Inventory**
- Current: Product catalog with all possible items
- Needed: Actual inventory with quantities on hand
- Missing: Stock levels, reorder points, usage tracking

### 2. **Recipe Ingredients Not Linked**
- Current: Recipes exist but no ingredient linkage
- Needed: Recipe ingredients linked to inventory items  
- Missing: Ingredient quantities, units, cost calculations

### 3. **Cost Calculations Not Working**
- Current: Static recipe costs from Toast
- Needed: Dynamic cost calculation from current ingredient prices
- Missing: Real-time cost updates when ingredient prices change

### 4. **Missing Core Features**
- No recipe ingredient management
- No inventory quantity tracking  
- No cost per serving calculations
- No profit margin analysis
- No yield calculations

## üéØ PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:

### HIGH PRIORITY:
1. **Recipe-Ingredient Linking System**
   - Add ingredients to recipes
   - Calculate recipe costs from ingredient costs
   - Update costs when ingredient prices change

2. **Inventory Management**  
   - Add quantity fields (on hand, par levels)
   - Track usage and ordering
   - Convert product list to true inventory

3. **Cost Calculation Engine**
   - Real-time recipe costing
   - Food cost percentage calculations
   - Profit margin analysis

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
4. **Data Cleanup**
   - Remove non-food items (rent, office supplies)
   - Standardize units of measure
   - Fix duplicate/similar items

5. **Enhanced UI**
   - Recipe builder interface
   - Inventory management screens
   - Cost analysis dashboards

### LOW PRIORITY:
6. **Advanced Features**
   - Waste tracking
   - Menu engineering
   - Purchasing suggestions
   - Reporting and analytics

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

1. **Clean Data** - Remove non-food items, standardize
2. **Recipe Builder** - Add interface to link ingredients to recipes  
3. **Cost Engine** - Build dynamic cost calculation system
4. **Inventory Tools** - Add quantity management
5. **Analytics** - Add profit analysis and reporting

This will transform it from a product catalog into a true restaurant management system.
